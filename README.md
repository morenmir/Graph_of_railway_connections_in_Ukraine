# Graph of railway connections in Ukraine
This project finds the optimal route from given directions and shows the duration of the trip, while visualizing the railway connections between cities of the country.

This project package consists of the following file: "Ukraine_railway_connections.ipynb". It includes all coding steps with two graphs:

1. Graph#1 - shows the railway connections between cities in the country
2. Graph#2 - shows the output of the program on the example of identified destination “Poltava-Odesa” with the duration of the travel. 

UPD. The first iteration of the project("Ukraine_railway_connections.ipynb") has been updated with a simplified structure, achieved through the utilization of .json and saved in the "Railway_connections_ua.ipynb" file .
